# Book Club Database

I created this database to keep track of the books we had read and restaurants we had visited as part of my book club. 

This was submitted as my final project for the Code First Girls Kickstarter Class Data & SQL.

### Built With

MySQL Workbench 8.0.36

### Aims

1. Create relational database of 6 tables to hold data about the books we were reading, the restaurants we were visiting and the members.
2. Use a subquery to update the books table with the average rating of the ratings from the member_ratings table.
3. Create [stored functions](https://github.com/Kat-tat/book-club/edit/main/README.md#stored-function-examples) to show whether a book is longer than average and to show whether a member has read a book.
4. Create joins and [views](https://github.com/Kat-tat/book-club/edit/main/README.md#view-examples) to display information from my database in my presentation.
